// This file (services/aiService.ts) previously contained code for LocalAI.
// LocalAI is no longer used in this project.
// The Gemini API is used instead, via services/geminiService.ts.
// This file's original content (related to LocalAI) was commented out
// but was reportedly still causing linting/compilation errors.
// The old code has been removed to resolve these errors and reflect its deprecated status.

/*
Original FIX comment from the now-removed content:
// FIX: Commenting out the entire file content as it's for LocalAI which is no longer used.
// The constants LOCALAI_CONFIG_ERROR_MESSAGE, LOCALAI_API_BASE_URL_DEFAULT, LOCALAI_DEFAULT_MODEL_NAME
// were removed from constants.ts, causing import errors here.
// App.tsx now uses geminiService.ts instead.
